This example manuscript is intended to serve as a tutorial and template for
authors to use when writing their own AAS Journal articles. The manuscript
includes a history of \aastex\ and documents the new features in the
previous versions as well as the bug fixes in version 6.31. This
manuscript includes many figure and table examples to illustrate these new
features.  Information on features not explicitly mentioned in the article
can be viewed in the manuscript comments or more extensive online
documentation. Authors are welcome replace the text, tables, figures, and
bibliography with their own and submit the resulting manuscript to the AAS
Journals peer review system.  The first lesson in the tutorial is to remind
authors that the AAS Journals, the Astrophysical Journal (ApJ), the
Astrophysical Journal Letters (ApJL), the Astronomical Journal (AJ), and
the Planetary Science Journal (PSJ) all have a 250 word limit for the 
abstract\footnote{Abstracts for Research Notes of the American Astronomical 
Society (RNAAS) are limited to 150 words}.  If you exceed this length the
Editorial office will ask you to shorten it. This abstract has 182 words.

    \label{fig:W1_lc}
\end{figure}



To quantitatively study variability, we calculated the intrinsic 
amplitude of variability ($\sigma_m$), which is the variance of the observed light curve after removing the measurement uncertainty \citep[see also][]{2017ApJ...842...96R}. The $\sigma_m$ is calculated using the following formalism described in \citet{2007AJ....134.2236S}.
\begin{equation}
\Sigma=\sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{N}(m_i - <m>)^2},
\end{equation}
where $m_i$ is the magnitude at $i$-th point and $<m>$ is the weighted average.
The amplitude of variability  can be written as  
$\sigma_m$ is             
\[\sigma_m  =
  \begin{cases}
    \sqrt{\Sigma^2 - \epsilon^2},  & \quad \text{if } \Sigma>\epsilon,\\
     0,                            & \quad  \text{otherwise.}\\
  \end{cases}
\]	               
where the error $\epsilon$ is calculated from the individual errors as follows
\begin{equation}
\epsilon^2=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=i}^{N}{\epsilon_{i}^{2} + \epsilon_{s}^2}. 
\end{equation}
Here $\epsilon_{i}$ is the measurement uncertainty of $i$-th point and $\epsilon_{s}$ is the systematic uncertainty. \citet{2011ApJ...735..112J} reported systematic uncertainties of 0.024 mag and 0.028 mag in $W$1 and $W$2 respectively. Therefore, this error has been added in quadrature to the measurement uncertainty and thus taking care of systematic as well as random errors. Spurious correlation may occur if $\sigma_m$ is not corrected for the redshift of the object, especially important for a flux-limited sample, we, therefore, calculated rest frame $\sigma_m$ by multiplying $\sigma_m$ with $\sqrt{(1+z)}$, which is based on the power spectral
density of variability having slope 2 \citep[see][]{2009ApJ...698..895K}. However, the majority ($\sim 87\%$) of the variable candidates in our sample is below $z=0.4$, thus, redshift correction is insignificant.















\subsection{X-ray data}
\subsubsection{\xrt}
The X-ray telescope (XRT) onboard \swift\, has high cadence-monitoring observations of the CLAGN sample. We use {\sc xselect} to extract the source and background spectra. The spectra are grouped by the a minimum of one count per bin. The XRT spectra in the 0.5--10~keV range are fitted by an absorbed power-law model \texttt{tbabs*zpowerlw} with the Galactic hydrogen absorption using the Bayesian X-ray Analysis software BXA \footnote{\url{http://johannesbuchner.github.io/BXA/index.html}} \citep[][]{2014A&A...564A.125B}.


\subsubsection{\maxi}
\textit{MAXI} \citep{2009PASJ...61..999M} onboard the International Space Station (ISS) performed all-sky monitor since 2009 August 15 with the Gas Slit Cameras (GSCs; \citealt{2011PASJ...63S.623M}) 
  in 2--30~keV and the Solid-state Slit Cameras (SSC; \citealt{2011PASJ...63..397T}) in 0.5--12~keV. Several CLAGNs has been monitored almost daily by \textit{MAXI}.  We extracted the light curves of CLAGNs with 1 day bin \footnote{\url{http://maxi.riken.jp/top/slist.html}}. 

  


\subsection{Optical V-band data}
\subsubsection{\uvot\,V-band}
 We use the tool \textit{uvotsource} to do the aperture photometry for V-band data of \uvot\,. The source aperture radius is 5$\arcsec$ and the background is chosen in a blank region with a much larger radius.


\subsubsection{ASAS-SN\,V-band data}
We used the photometric data of NGC 1566 from the ASAS-SN \citep[All-sky Automated Survey for Supernovae,][]{2014ApJ...788...48S,2017PASP..129j4502K,2019MNRAS.485..961J}. ASAS-SN \citep[][]{2018ATel11893....1D} reported the brightening of NGC 1566 around September 2017, which is brightest in July 2018. We determined the average offset between the simultaneous (within 1 day of interval) ASAS-SN and \uvot\, V-band data. Then the ASAS-SN\,V-band magnitude was reduced to the V-band of \uvot\, system.

\subsection{MIR variability timescale}
We fited the light curves using a damped random walk model in {\sc javelin} algorithm \citep[][]{2011ApJ...735...80Z,2013ApJ...765..106Z} to estimate the MIR variability timescale. We limited the range of timescale within $90-10^{6}$ days due to its 180 day's sampling rate and 10 year's monitoring. We find the distributions of timescale are guassian-like with log${\uptau _{W1}}\sim 2.35\pm 0.01$ and log ${\uptau_{W2}}\sim 2.47\pm 0.02$. The ratio between ${\uptau _{W1}}$ and ${\uptau _{W2}}$ is $\sim 3:4$ ($225:298$). We ploted the distributions of MIR variability timescale in \autoref{fig:distribution_MIRtimescale}.

%At the resolution of ASAS-SN, the local crowding will tend to change the light curve by some constant in flux, distorting its shape
% Contamination due to the local crowding will generally distort an ASAS-SN light curve by an additive constant in flux.


Combining the results from literature, we plot the dust-reverberation time lag ($\tau_{W1}$) and bolometric luminosity ($L_\mathrm{bol}$) relation of AGNs in \autoref{fig:tau_L}. \citet[][]{2019ApJ...886...33L} reported that the inferred dust emission size ratios $R_\mathrm{K}$: $R_{W1}$: $R_{W2}$ are $0.6: 1: 1.2$. So we multiplied $\tau_\mathrm{K}$ in \citet[][]{2014ApJ...788..159K,2019ApJ...886...33L} by a factor of 5/3. We used UltraNest\footnote{\url{https://johannesbuchner.github.io/UltraNest/}} package \citep{2021JOSS....6.3001B} to fit the linear log$\tau$-log$L_{bol}$ relation for Type 1s, Type 2s, and CLAGNs with errors considered. The fitting results show a slope of $0.36 \pm 0.04$, an offset of $2.13 \pm 0.03$, and a scatter of $0.17 \pm 0.02$. Though the slope ($0.36 \pm 0.04$) is slightly lower than the slope ($0.47 \pm 0.06$) from fitting of PG quasars in \citet[][]{2019ApJ...886...33L}, the $\tau$-$L_{bol}$ relation are consistent for CLAGNs and normal AGNs with scatter.


%Seyfert 1.5 galaxy Mrk 530 experienced twice ``changing-look'' \citep{2019sf2a.conf..509M} during 1974-1998 and underwent a transition from a soft to hard spectrum with \suzaku\, in 2012 \citep{2018MNRAS.478.4214E}. The MIR light curve shows gradually decline of luminosity in recent years.


%NGC 7582 is a X-ray bright Seyfert galaxy, which changed from type 2 to type 1 in 1998 \citep{2019sf2a.conf..509M}. NGC 7582 showed highly variable absorption features around 2000 \citep{2015ApJ...815...55R}. NGC 7582 experienced an outburst in MIR band around November 2018, reached the bright luminosity level around November 2010. NGC 7582 are slowly dimming.
